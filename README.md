# Computer Sit Timer
This is a simple countdown timer that pops up 
and stays on top to block the view until action is taken.
It is similar to pomodoro technique,
but started from different motivation:
to not sit extensively in front of computer for better health.

Several reasons why I re-invented the wheel instead of using existing (browser) apps:
light-weight, blocking/really obtrusive, not browser extension/app 
(as we all spend far too long on browsers), 
runs in the notification tray (background) and not have a console/terminal there.

Also, a hobby project for myself to try out developing desktop application with Python.
Because I am lazy, I am now trying to use [`pySimpleGUI`](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/)
(more specifically `pySimpleGUIQt` for the tray)
to do so.


## Resources:
 - [official Cookbook for pySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/).
 - [trinket tutorials](https://pysimplegui.trinket.io/demo-programs#/demo-programs/multi-threaded-work)
   has quite something there (examples).
   It is basically like a VM and can run code and windows there.
