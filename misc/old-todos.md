- Advanced features (wishes):
    - [ ] ðŸš© converting to enable timed script execution (either this is the base and the other extends from this, or total conversion)
    - Visual
        - [x] icon
        - [ ] tray icon & main icon that changes over time
    - [x] stay just at tray notification and no active window and run in background
        - using not the native tray icon but good enough
    - [X] ~~notification sound~~ removed
    - [ ] dim out screen when time's up
    - [x] always on top when time is up!
        - `window.keepOnTop` does not work, instead use solution from 
          [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/2977)
- won't fix
    - (medium) as Ui is blocking call, any action on the tray will 
      queue up and executed after UI is closed
      - if using multiprocessing, too much communication between 
        CountDowner, MainTray and PopUp (mp convention should not put 
        CountDowner in shared memory but something small).
      - Perhaps if later want to try standard ui async callback style
    - (performance, enhancement) `ShowUI` call is a bit slow, takes about 8 seconds for the ui to pop-up when time's up
    - (performance, minor) right-click on tray pauses the loop, as in time is not updated during that time.
          Not really that much of an issue for me because I won't right-click all the time and accurate time is not needed.
